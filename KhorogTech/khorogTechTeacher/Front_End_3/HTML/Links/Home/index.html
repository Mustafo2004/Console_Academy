        Welcome to our comprehensive guide on Artificial Intelligence (AI). Dive into the fascinating world of AI, its applications, and the technologies driving it forward.
    </p>

    <h3 id="about">About AI</h3>
    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. Here are some key areas in AI:

    </ol>

    <h5 id="history">History</h5>
    <img width="300px" src="../Assets/AiHistory.jpg" alt="AI History">
    <p>
        The history of AI dates back to ancient myths and stories, but modern AI research began in the mid-20th century. Key milestones include the development of the Turing Test and the advent of machine learning algorithms.
    </p>

    <h5 id="types">Types</h5>
    <p>
        AI can be categorized into three main types:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="#narrow">Narrow AI</a></li>
        <li><a href="#general">General AI</a></li>
        <li><a href="#superintelligent">Superintelligent AI</a></li>
    </ol>

    <h5 id="narrow">Narrow AI</h5>
    <p>
        Narrow AI, also known as Weak AI, is designed to perform a narrow task (e.g., facial recognition, internet searches). It operates under a limited set of constraints and contexts.
    </p>

    <h5 id="general">General AI</h5>
    <p>
        General AI, or Strong AI, is a type of AI that has the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at the level of a human being.
    </p>

    <h5 id="superintelligent">Superintelligent AI</h5>
    <p>
        Superintelligent AI surpasses human intelligence and can perform tasks better than humans in virtually every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills.
    </p>

    <h5 id="ethics">Ethics</h5>
    <p>
        The development and deployment of AI raise ethical questions about privacy, bias, accountability, and the future of human jobs. Ethical AI aims to address these concerns through principles and guidelines.
    </p>

    <h3 id="applications">Applications</h3>
    <p>
        AI has a wide range of applications across various industries. Here are some of the most impactful applications:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="#healthcare">Healthcare</a></li>
        <li><a href="#finance">Finance</a></li>
        <li><a href="#transportation">Transportation</a></li>
        <li><a href="#education">Education</a></li>
    </ol>

    <h5 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h5>
    <img width="300px" src="../Assets/AI-in-Healthcare.jpg" alt="AI in Healthcare">
    <p>
        In healthcare, AI is used for diagnosing diseases, personalizing treatment plans, and managing patient records. AI-powered tools can analyze medical data and assist doctors in making more accurate decisions.
    </p>

    <h5 id="finance">Finance</h5>
    <p>
        AI is transforming finance through fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and personalized banking services. Machine learning models analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and predict market trends.
    </p>

    <h5 id="transportation">Transportation</h5>
    <img width="300px" src="../Assets/ai-transportaion.jpg" alt="AI in Transportation">
    <p>
        AI applications in transportation include self-driving cars, traffic management systems, and predictive maintenance. AI enhances safety and efficiency in the transportation industry.
    </p>

    <h5 id="education">Education</h5>
    <p>
        AI in education provides personalized learning experiences, automates administrative tasks, and offers intelligent tutoring systems. AI helps educators understand and cater to individual student needs.
    </p>

    <h3 id="technologies">Technologies</h3>
    <p>
        The core technologies driving AI are diverse and rapidly evolving. Key technologies include:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="#ml">Machine Learning</a></li>
        <li><a href="#dl">Deep Learning</a></li>
        <li><a href="#nlp">Natural Language Processing</a></li>
    </ol>

    <h5 id="ml">Machine Learning</h5>
    <p>
        Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms build models based on sample data, known as "training data".
    </p>

    <h5 id="dl">Deep Learning</h5>
    <p>
        Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML involving neural networks with three or more layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain to "learn" from large amounts of data.
    </p>

    <h5 id="nlp">Natural Language Processing</h5>
    <p>
        Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. NLP applications include language translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbots.
